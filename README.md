# Responsive Dashboard Interface

## Project Overview

This project is a responsive web interface built using React and Next.js, following the design principles and guidelines provided in the selection criteria task. The interface includes a dashboard with various components such as a Navbar, Sidebar, Overview Cards, Analytics Chart, and User Table.

## Approach

1. **Setup:**
    - Initialized a React.js project.
    - Installed and configured Tailwind CSS for styling.
    - Used TypeScript for enhanced type safety and maintainability.

2. **Design:**
    - Created a responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
    - Ensured the design is user-friendly and aligns with WCAG accessibility guidelines.

3. **Components:**
    - Developed reusable components: Navbar, Sidebar, MainContent, OverviewCard, AnalyticsChart, and UserTable.
    - Used Tailwind CSS classes to style the components and ensure responsiveness.

4. **API Integration:**
    - Integrated a dummy RESTful API using JSONPlaceholder to fetch user data for the UserTable component.
    - Implemented error handling and loading states for API requests.

5. **Accessibility:**
    - Followed WCAG guidelines to ensure the interface is accessible.
    - Used semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes where necessary.

6. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Optimized the interface for fast load times and smooth user experience.
    - Ensured cross-browser compatibility and tested on various platforms and devices.

## Challenges


- Maintaining design consistency across different screen sizes.
- Integrating the dummy RESTful API and handling potential errors.

## Scalability and Optimization

- The project is built with scalability in mind, using reusable components and modular code.
- Future enhancements can include integrating real APIs, adding more features, and optimizing performance further.
- The code is structured to allow easy maintenance and extension.
